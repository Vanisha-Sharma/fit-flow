          <h1>Meal Timing & Recovery</h1>
          <p>
            Eating the right foods at the right times can enhance both
            performance and recovery. Consuming a balanced meal of proteins and
            carbohydrates before workouts provides energy and supports muscle
            endurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After training, refueling with protein and carbs within 30 to 60
            minutes helps replenish glycogen stores and initiates muscle repair.
            Additionally, staying hydrated throughout the day is critical for
            optimal performance and recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Planning your meals around your training schedule can make a
            noticeable difference in how your body responds to exercise. Monitor
            how your body feels and adjust your nutrition accordingly to keep
            progressing towards your goals.
