          <p>
            Start with basic planks, side planks, and leg raises to establish a
            strong foundation. These movements engage the deep core muscles
            responsible for stability and control. Gradually progress to more
            dynamic exercises such as mountain climbers, Russian twists, and
            hollow body holds.
          </p>
          <p>
            For advanced training, consider incorporating resistance bands,
            stability balls, or hanging leg raises to challenge your core
            further. Aim for consistency by including core workouts in your
            training routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on
            quality reps over quantity to build genuine strength and endurance
