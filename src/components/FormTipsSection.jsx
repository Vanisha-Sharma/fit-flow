          <h1>Perfecting Your Form<br />for Maximum Gains</h1>
          <p>
            Proper form is essential for achieving the best possible results from your training. Without it,
            you risk injury and limit your muscle activation, ultimately reducing your progress. Focus on
            mastering the basics before increasing the intensity or complexity of your workouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start with foundational movements such as squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and pull-ups. Work with
            lighter weights or bodyweight until your form is solid. From there, gradually increase resistance
            while maintaining proper technique. Pay attention to cues like maintaining a neutral spine,
            engaging your core, and avoiding unnecessary strain on joints.
          </p>
          <p>
            Receiving feedback from a coach or recording yourself during exercises can be invaluable.
            Analyzing your form helps identify weaknesses or imbalances, allowing you to make adjustments and
            avoid injury. When executed correctly, each repetition maximizes muscle engagement, promoting
            both strength gains and overall stability.
