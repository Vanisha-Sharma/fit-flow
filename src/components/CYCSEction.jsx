      <h2 className="blog-title">Why Core Strength Matters</h2>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        The core is more than just your abs—it’s a complex network of muscles
        including the lower back, hips, and glutes. Developing a strong core
        enhances overall stability, balance, and posture, serving as the
        foundation for virtually every movement your body performs.
      </p>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        When your core is properly conditioned, it provides essential support to
        your spine and reduces the risk of injuries during physical activities.
        Whether you’re lifting weights, playing sports, or simply carrying
        groceries, a strong core ensures your body remains stable and efficient.
      </p>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        Additionally, core training improves athletic performance. Movements
        that require coordination, balance, and power all originate from the
        core. Strengthening these muscles translates to better control and
        precision during exercises, enhancing both endurance and explosiveness.
